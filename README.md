# Tetro-Advance, Gameboy Advance port of Tetro (a Tetris clone)

![Untitled](https://github.com/ArtificialRaccoon/Tetro-Advance/blob/main/demo.gif)


A very simple tetris clone for the Gameboy Advance. Fully playable, and supports both 7-Bag and Tetris Grand Master randomization. 

This is a straight port of my [DOS version](https://github.com/ArtificialRaccoon/Tetro), and was mostly just a learning exercise. 

Still has some spitpolish to do, such as figuring what the heck to do on the left side of the screen (since I dont have enough room for the statistics now).

Tooling: 
- (devkitpro)[https://github.com/devkitpro]
- (vscode-gba-dev)[https://github.com/ArtificialRaccoon/vscode-gba-dev]

Features:

- SRAM High Score Save!
- Tetris?
